"Justify the choice of the main technology (e.g. Vanilla JS / React / Vue etc.)."

Your answer:

ReactJS (and frontend UI frameworks/libraries in general) is a perfect solution for 
dynamically changing webpage's content depending on the user's input - which is 
exactly the case with the clothing products and their color filters provided in 
this task.

React does it quicker than Vannila JS, thanks to virtual DOM. The library calculates
which DOM nodes have to be changed when user provides an input value and changes
only these nodes (instead of all of them).

Also, React's components make it easy to reuse similiar elements with different 
data across the page.

The product card is a good example. It follows the same build/pattern of thumbnail, 
button, price etc. (which can be defined as a component), but the data and some 
minor elements (sale icon, crossed out number) do change depending on the product.

React routing could be used as well, potentially - depending on the content of 
webpages that navigation section redirects to.
